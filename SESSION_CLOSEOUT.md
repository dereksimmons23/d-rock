# Session Close-Out Summary

---

## Session: January 29, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Playlist curation, song revision, IP protection.

### Completed Tonight

**IP Protection:**
- ✅ Gitignored `docs/`, `screenshots/`, `ghost-road-trip.txt`
- ✅ Untracked from git, committed, pushed
- Personal writing, lyrics, playlists, backstory stay local only

**Song Revised:**
- ✅ "Road Trip Songs" renamed to **"Drunken Eden"** (`docs/drunken-eden.md`)
- Updated: fifty-three not forty-three, cowboy abbreviations (til, nothin', drivin', ridin', cryin'), tighter rhymes
- "spin the story machine" replaced "spin the tallest tales"
- "mostly just shrugged" replaced "mostly just listened"
- "that's how cowboys roll" — harder landing

**New Playlist Created:**
- ✅ **Take Me to Church** (`docs/take-me-to-church.md`) — 15 tracks
- Seed: Celeste — "Strange." Storytellers who don't flinch.
- Celeste, Michael Kiwanuka, Tracy Chapman, Jason Isbell, Kacey Musgraves, Mason Proper, Hozier, Jeff Buckley, Gregory Alan Isakov, Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone, Chris Stapleton, Zach Bryan

**Playlists Expanded:**
- ✅ **Rage Against The White Keys** — now 20 tracks (added The Hand That Feeds, Testify, Sober)
- ✅ **Songbird** (was From Icons to Bygones) — now 10 tracks (added Purple Rain, Heroes, Hallelujah, Free Fallin', Respect, Black Hole Sun, Everlong, Songbird, Nothing Compares 2 U)

**All Playlists Named (track-name rule):**

| Playlist | File | Tracks | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Take Me to Church | `docs/take-me-to-church.md` | 15 | Storytellers who don't flinch |
| Rage Against The White Keys | `docs/rage-against-the-white-keyes.md` | 20 | The mashup sermon |
| Coffee & Cookies for Breakfast | `docs/coffee-and-cookies-for-breakfast.md` | 35 | Mom's playlist. Song to write. |
| Goodbye Yellow Brick Road | `docs/goodbye-yellow-brick-road.md` | 82 | Jackson trip. Kansas kid leaves Kansas. |
| Songbird | `docs/songbird.md` | 10 | Cultural grief. When the legends die. |
| Black Sheep | `docs/black-sheep.md` | 2 | The ones who don't fit the flock |

### Next Session

**Songs to Write:**
- [ ] "Coffee and Cookies for Breakfast" — mom's song
- [ ] Continue refining "Drunken Eden"

**Persona:**
- [ ] Add Derek's soundtrack to Black Sheep
- [ ] Finish Lost Highway (~6 more songs)
- [ ] Map energy states to Spotify audio features (valence, energy, tempo)

**Build (Phase 1):**
- [ ] Set up Netlify site for d-rock
- [ ] Configure subdomain: d-rock.claudewill.io
- [ ] Create Spotify Developer app
- [ ] Get ElevenLabs voice ID (Derek's clone)
- [ ] Build PWA shell + ElevenLabs voice test
- [ ] Build mic input (Web Speech API)

### Key Insight

Every playlist has a name now. Not a description — a track. The playlist wears one of its own songs. That's D-Rock logic: the music names itself.

**Dad's saying:** "Always Eternal Hope." It's on his gravestone. But also: Always *is* Eternal. Remember that.

*"See you on the B side."*
