# D-Rock Music — Concept Document

## The Spark

Hitster beat BOB at Christmas. Why? Instant recognition. Nostalgia. Music = memory.

But Hitster uses audio. Audio has problems (APIs, copyright, iOS playback, accessibility).

**Visual lyrics don't.**

---

## Core Concept

Show lyrics. Guess the song. Remember who gave it to you.

**Not trivia. Memory.**

---

## The Progression Mechanic

```
One line → 10 points (superfans)
More lines → 7 points (recognition)
Full verse → 4 points (piecing it together)
Audio snippet → 2 points (lifeline)
Answer revealed → 0 points
```

Points decrease. Emotional stakes increase.

## Sample Lyrics (From Session)

| Lyric | Song | Artist |
|-------|------|--------|
| "Fix me!" | Fix You? | Coldplay? |
| "Years gone by, I'd say we've kicked some ass" | ? | ? |
| "The Earth starts to rumble" | Symphony of Destruction | Megadeth |
| "Why can't we not be sober?" | Sober | Tool |

*Note: Need to verify and build library*

## This Isn't BOB

**BOB:** Deadpan. Detached. Observes chaos. Game show host energy.

**This Host:** Weathered. Moody. IN it. Feels the lyrics. Curator energy.

### Host Personality (Unnamed)

- Black sheep energy
- Dangerously brilliant vibes
- Says things like:
  - "You didn't pick this song. It picked you."
  - "Somebody gave you this one. Doesn't mean they gave you everything."
  - "This one's a road trip song."
  - "The song's still good. Even if they weren't."

Not sentimental. Not bitter. Honest.

---

## The Inspiration

**Derek's dad:** Queen on road trips. Nickerson, Kansas to Waynoka, Oklahoma. Two hours of Freddie Mercury through wheat fields. Dangerously brilliant. Legendary storyteller. Crappy parent. But he gave you Queen.

**Derek's mom:** Blue Christmas. Elvis. A $19 record player from an auction in the '80s. Seen better days. Still works.

**The game is inheritance.** The complicated kind. The music survives the bullshit.

---

## Themes / Mood Curation

Not random songs. **Curated for resonance.**

- "The World's on Fire" — chaos, destruction, apocalypse
- "Fix Me" — vulnerability, brokenness, recovery
- "Kicked Some Ass" — triumph, defiance, victory
- "Sober" — addiction, struggle, clarity
- "Road Trip" — freedom, escape, windows down

The lyrics hit different when they match the moment.

---

## Game vs. Engine

**Game Mode (Party):**
- Rounds, points, competition
- "Who knows this first?"
- Progressive reveal mechanic
- Multiplayer, speed-based

**Engine Mode (Solo):**
- Curated by mood/theme
- "Here's what you need to hear"
- Personal, reflective
- Playlist generation

Same library. Same curation. Different delivery.

---

## Brand Architecture

**D-Rock** = The umbrella / brand
**[Host Name TBD]** = The weathered curator personality
**Lyricists** = Working title for party game mode

---

## Technical Notes (Future)

- Visual lyrics = no API dependency to start
- Spotify aesthetic (bold text, color backgrounds)
- Could add audio snippets as "lifeline" tier
- Supabase for library storage
- React frontend (matches BOB architecture)

---

## Parked Until

**Q2 2026** — Circle back after:
- BOB v3 ships (social mechanics)
- CW Strategies stabilizes
- Coach D platform progress

---

## The Core Truth

> "The song's still good. Even if they weren't."

Music is what survives. This game is a way to hold onto what was worth keeping.

---

*Nickerson to Waynoka. Queen to Elvis. The $19 record player.*

*It's in there somewhere.*
